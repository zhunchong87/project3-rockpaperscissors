# Project 3 - RockPaperScissors
This is a smart contract named RockPaperScissors whereby:
1. Alice and Bob play the classic rock paper scissors game.
2. To enrol, each player needs to deposit the right Ether amount, possibly zero.
3. To play, each player submits their unique move.
4. The contract decides and rewards the winner with all Ether wagered.

## How to start
1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
2. Run `truffle compile` to build.
3. Run `truffle develop` to initialize the dev environment.
4. Run `migrate` to deploy the Remittance contract.
5. Run `test` to run the basic test cases.

#### Sample:
```
npm install
truffle compile
truffle develop
migrate

```
